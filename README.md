## Introduction
During the 4 months of this journey, using python libraries I developed strong skills by working on 5 projects that interesting in:
 
- Advanced SQL 
- Parctical Statistics
- Data Wrangling 
- Data Visulization

### Prerequisites

Most of the projects will use [Python](https://www.python.org) and [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html). You can download [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)
